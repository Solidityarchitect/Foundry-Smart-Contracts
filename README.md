**foundry-defi-stablecoin:** Similar to the DAI stablecoin issued by MakerDAO, it provides users with staking, minting, and liquidation functions based on health factors and thresholds. By anchoring the U.S. dollar price, rising prices burn to stabilize prices, while falling prices increase liquidity.
